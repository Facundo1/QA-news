    <h1>Vaccine Misinformation Targets Hispanic and Black Communities</h1>
    <h2>
      False information, presented on social media and alternative sites
      influences people who have historically
      mistrusted doctors. Activists go door-to-door to disprove it.</h2>

      It was shortly after 11:00 am when they encountered the first person reluctant to get vaccinated. Two doors and a
      half hour later it happened again. For nearly an hour they were in the front yard of 67-year-old George Rodriguez,
      chatting about the neighborhood, the pandemic, and available vaccines.</p>
    <p>
      “I see all these things online, how my DNA is going to change. It does something to DNA, right? ”Asked Rodriguez,
      who is Hispanic. “There are many things, a lot of contradictory information. And then I hear that if you get
      vaccinated anyway you can get sick. Why do I get vaccinated, then?</p>
    <p>


      Black and Hispanic communities, which have been the hardest hit by the pandemic and whose vaccination rates are
      slower than those of white people, confront conspiracy theories about vaccines, rumors and misleading news reports
      on social networks such as Facebook, Instagram , YouTube and Twitter as well as private messaging apps, health
      authorities and misinformation investigators said.
      The misinformation varies. There are claims that vaccines alter DNA - which is not true - and that vaccines don't
      work, or that people of color are used as guinea pigs. Much of this misinformation comes from friends, family and
      celebrities and comes up in communities that have been particularly impacted by the pandemic and that face a
      number of obstacles to getting vaccinated.</p>

    <p>
      Foreign media and anti-vaccine activists have also aggressively tried to cast doubt on the safety and efficacy of
      vaccines made in the United States and Europe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Misinformation has complicated efforts by some states to reach out to black and Hispanic residents, particularly
      as health officials have given special registration codes for vaccination appointments. Rather than being seen as
      a benefit, the codes have become the basis for new false accounts.

      "What at first might be perceived as a prioritization of communities of color by doctors actually looks online as,
      'Oh, those doctors want us to go first to be guinea pigs,'" said Kolina Koltai. , a researcher at the University
      of Washington who studies conspiracy theories online. "I've seen people on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, the
      Clubhouse - anywhere - who say the codes are a way to force communities of color to get vaccinated as an
      experiment."

    <p>
      Research conducted in mid-February by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation in mid-February <a
        href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/press-release/new-analysis-updated-state-data-continues-to-show-wide-disparities-in-covid-19-vaccination-rates-by-race-ethnicity/"></a>
      a striking
      disparity between the racial groups that have been vaccinated in 34 states that reported such information.
    </p>
    Figures vary widely by state. In Texas, where people who identify as Hispanic make up 42 percent of the
    population, only 20 percent of vaccines had gone to that group. In Mississippi, where black people make up 38
    percent of the population, they received 22 percent of the vaccines. <a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/05/us/vaccine-racial-disparities.html">According to an
      analysis by The New York
      Times</a> , the vaccination rate for black Americans is half the rate for whites and the gap with Hispanic
    Americans
    is even greater.

    Although the researchers say that the lack of access facilities for vaccine sites could be the main factor in that
    deficit, misinformation is playing a role.

    The belief that physicians have an interest in experimenting with certain communities is deeply ingrained among
    certain groups, Koltai said. Anti-vaccine activists have turned to historical examples, including Nazi doctors who
    conducted experiments in concentration camps and from the Baltimore hospital where cancer cells were collected 70
    years ago from Henrietta Lacks, a black woman and mother of five. guys <a

    <h3>“The thing about disinformation is that it works best when it is built around something of truth. <br> In this
      case,many communities of color are wary of the medical system because they haven't had the best experience, ”said
      Shireen Mitchell<br>, founder of <a href="https://stoponlinevaw.com/">Stop Online Violence Against Women</a> , a
      group that supports women of color who are
      bullied online.

      An experiment carried out in 1943 on nearly 400 black men in Tuskegee, Alabama is one of the most researched
      examples of medical abuse in the black community. For four decades, scientists observed the men, who knew they
      were infected with syphilis, but did not offer them treatments so that they could study the progression of the
      disease. When the experiment came to light in the 1970s it <a
        href="https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/news/researchers-and-students-run-pilot-project-oakland-test-whether-tuskegee-syphilis-trial-last">was
        condemned by the medical community</a> as a major violation of ethical standards.</p>
    <p>
      Researchers studying disinformation have tracked mentions of Tuskegee on social media over the past year. While
      Tuskegee averaged several hundred weekly mentions on Facebook and Twitter, there were notable spikes of interest
      that coincided with the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, according to Zignal labs, a media-watching company.

    </p>
    <p>
      In the last week of November, when Modern Pharma and Pfizer released promising results in the latest safety trials
      of their COVID-19 vaccines, mentions of Tuskegee rose to 7,000 a week.

    </p>
    <p>
      There was another respite until about mid-December, when the FDA announced that it had granted emergency approval
      to the vaccines. Tuskegee mentions reached nearly 5,000 that week, according to Zignal; one of the most viral
      tweets referred to coronavirus vaccines as "the new Tuskegee study."

      Doctors report battling vaccine reluctance in other demographic groups. Last month, a poll by the NORC Research
      Center for Public Affairs found that 23 percent of Republicans said they would " definitely " get vaccinated while
      21 percent said they would "probably" not get vaccinated.

    </p>

    <p>
      Native American groups have been battling vaccination fears in their communities, and doctors say some
      Chinese-American patients come forward with Chinese-language media articles questioning US-made vaccines.

      Many black and Hispanic people already had difficulty making appointments and accessing vaccination centers, which
      are often located in more affluent neighborhoods with white residents. And officials in some cities say that
      people in those neighborhoods have also been <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/02/health/white-people-covid-vaccines-minorities.html">flooding
        vaccination appointment systems</a> and taking supplies destined
      for poorer black and Hispanic residents.
    </p>

    <p>
      Misinformation about who can get the vaccine and when it's available and how its safety was tested has added
      further difficulties, Mitchell said.

      At a mass vaccination center at the Oakland Coliseum on a recent Friday afternoon, before 68-year-old Anthony
      Jones agreed to inject himself, there was just one more thing he wanted to check out on Facebook. He pulled out
      his phone and began typing, ignoring his grandson, who had driven him to the appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I read about a woman who died of this thing and I want to see if she was black," said Jones, who after several
      minutes of swiping his finger across the screen, couldn't find the Facebook post he was looking for. "You see a
      lot of things on the internet that make you think, as a black man, that you shouldn't accept this vaccine."
    </p>

    <p>
      In the end Jones gave up. On the way to the vaccine, he recalled that the article he had seen was on WhatsApp,
      which is owned by Facebook, and that it was from a site that he did not recognize.

      "My grandson tells me not to believe everything I read on the internet," he said. "I like to believe my grandson."

      The next day, 38-year-old Daniel Lander was touring a San José neighborhood with 28-year-old Armand Mateos. For
      the past five months, Lander has been going door-to-door as part of a program run by Working Partnerships USA, a
      Silicon Valley-based community organization. The group works with county officials to help combat misinformation
      about the pandemic and vaccines.
    </p>

    <p>
      “We hear people say they saw this or that such a celebrity shared something on Twitter or Instagram that made them
      think the vaccine was a bad idea. People value the opinion of the people they look up to and these celebrities
      have a lot of influence, ”said Lander.
    </p>
    <p>
      While chatting with Rodriguez, a muscular man and enthusiastic talkative, Lander and Mateos said they empathized
      with his concerns. They said that they had had many of these doubts and explained how they had decided to get
      vaccinated. Rodriguez asked them where they had been vaccinated and how they had felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mateos touched his left arm by reflex, where he said that a few weeks ago they had given him the vaccine. He said
      it hurt and they weren't going to deny it. But he was convinced that it was safe and that it would help keep him
      and his loved ones from getting sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They've read all this stuff online from different news sources, which is confusing. But then they know me, as
      someone who has been vaccinated and I can give them real answers, ”said Mateos. He added that many people were
      citing articles in the Spanish versions of news networks such as <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/technology/russia-covid-vaccine-disinformation.html">Sputnik and Russia
        Today</a> backed by the Russian
      government. “They don't trust American vaccines. People read those notes and they don't want to get vaccinated ”.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the two men were leaving, Rodriguez yelled at them that he was going to get vaccinated that week. They made
      sure he had the phone number and websites to sign up and continued down the block.
