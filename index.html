        "What at first might be perceived as a prioritization of communities of
        color by doctors actually looks online as, 'Oh, those doctors want us to
        go first to be guinea pigs,'" said Kolina Koltai. , a University of
        Washington researcher who studies conspiracy theories online. "I've seen
        people on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, the Clubhouse - anywhere - who say
        the codes are a way to force communities of color to get vaccinated as
        an experiment."

        “The thing about disinformation is that it works best when it is built
        around something of truth. In this case, many communities of color are
        wary of the medical system because they haven't had the best experience,
        ”said Shireen Mitchell, founder of Stop Online Violence Against Women, a
        group that supports women of color who are bullied online.

        An experiment conducted in 1943 on nearly 400 black men in Tuskegee,
        Alabama is one of the most researched examples of medical abuse in the
        black community. For four decades, scientists observed the men, who knew
        they were infected with syphilis, but did not offer them treatments so
        that they could study the progression of the disease. When the
        experiment came to light in the 1970s it was condemned by the medical
        community as a major violation of ethical standards.

        Native American groups have been battling vaccination fears in their
        communities, and doctors say some Chinese-American patients come forward
        with Chinese-language media articles questioning US-made vaccines.
