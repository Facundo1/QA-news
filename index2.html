            In 1957, Isaac Asimov published <a href="https://asimov.fandom.com/wiki/The_Naked_Sun"> The Naked Sun</a> ,
            a science fiction novel about a society in which people live
            on isolated farms, robots meet their needs and only interact through videos. The plot revolves around the
            way in which this lack of face-to-face contact atrophies and distorts their personalities.

        </div>
        <p>
            After a year in which those of us were able to work from home - though instead of robots, like the novel, we
            are served by less fortunate humans - that sounds pretty familiar. But how will we live once the pandemic
            passes?
        </p>

        <p>
            No one knows for sure, of course. But perhaps our speculation can be supported by some historical parallels
            and models.

            Indeed, a year of isolation gave remote work a classic case of “infant industry” protection, a concept often
            associated with international trade policy and which was first systematically exposed by none other than
            <a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-10-02-0001-0007">Alexander Hamilton</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hamilton claimed that there were many industries that could flourish in the young America but could not
            thrive on imports. If these industries were given a breather from competition through temporary tariffs, for
            example, they could gain enough experience and technological sophistication to become competitive.
        </p>

        <p>
            The infant industry argument has always been a complicated one as a basis for public policy: how do you know
            when it is valid? And can we trust governments to make that decision? But the pandemic, by temporarily
            making our old work habits impossible, has undoubtedly allowed us to take much better advantage of the
            possibilities of remote work; Plus, some of what we used to do — long trips to sit in cubicles, constant
            flights to meetings of questionable value — won't come back.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, if history is any guide, much of our former way of working and living will return.

            Here's a parallel: what the internet changed and didn't change in how we read books.
        </p>
        <p>
            A decade ago, many people believed that both physical books and the bookstores that sold them were on the
            way to extinction. And part of what they predicted came true: e-readers took a significant share of the
            market, and large bookstore chains suffered a significant financial hit.
        </p>

        <p>
            But the popularity of e-books <a
                href="https://blog.submittable.com/publishing-industry-trends/">stagnated</a> in the middle of the past
            decade, never surpassing physical books.
            And while the big chains have suffered, independent bookstores have flourished.
        </p>

            Why has the reading revolution been so limited? The convenience of downloading e-books is obvious. But for
            many readers this convenience is offset by more subtle factors. The experience of reading a physical book is
            different and, for many, more enjoyable than reading in electronic ink. And visiting a bookstore is also a
            different experience than shopping online. I like to say that on the internet I can find any book I am
            looking for; in fact, I downloaded a copy of The Naked Sun a few hours before writing this article. However,
            what I find in a bookstore, especially in a well-preserved independent one, are <a
                href="https://www.nytimes.com/es/2018/11/25/espanol/opinion/manguel-amazon-libreros.html">books that I
                was not looking</a>
            for , but that I end up treasuring.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perhaps the remote work revolution will unfold in a similar way, but on a much larger scale.
        </p>
        <p>
            The benefits of telecommuting (whether from home or perhaps in small offices located far from dense urban
            areas) are obvious. Both living and working spaces are getting cheaper; transfers are short or non-existent;
            You no longer need to deal with the expense and discomfort of formal business wear, at least from the waist
            down.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead, the advantages of returning to face-to-face work will be relatively subtle: the benefits of
            face-to-face communication, the serendipity that can arise from unscheduled interactions, the comforts of
            urban life.
        </p>

    <div class='p-container'>
        <p>
            Yet these subtle advantages are what drive the economy of modern cities and, until before the advent of
            COVID-19, these advantages fueled a <a
                href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/CUNY_GC/media/LISCenter/pkrugman/REGIONAL-ECONOMICS-3rd-transition.pdf">growing
                economic divergence</a> between large, highly educated metropolitan
            areas and the rest of the world. U.S. The rise in telecommuting may curb that trend, but it is unlikely to
            reverse it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The resurgence of cities will not be an entirely pleasant process; much of this will perhaps reflect the
            preferences of wealthy Americans who desire the luxuries and glamor of big cities. "The main problem with
            moving to Florida is that you have to live in Florida, " a fund manager told Bloomberg. But while cities
            thrive in part because they adapt to the lifestyles of the rich and fatuous - whether they like it or not,
            their wealth and power go a long way toward shaping the economy - cities also thrive because much of the
            trade information and brainstorming takes place during coffee and beer breaks after work hours; Zoom calls
            are not a suitable substitute.
        </p>
        <p>
            Or as the great Victorian economist <a href="">Alfred Marshall</a> said about the technological centers of
            his time: "The
            mysteries of the trade cease to be, but they are, so to speak, in the air."
        </p>
        <p>
            So the best bet is that life and work in, say, 2023 will look a lot like life and work in 2019, but to a
            lesser extent. We may travel less than we used to to the office; there may be an excess of urban office
            space. But most of us will not be able to be far from the madding crowd.
